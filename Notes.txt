README is clear. You can insert mathematical symbols as you would write them in laTeX.

You could split the functions and classes declarations in different header files, organized by their purpose and collected in an include foalder.
You could have let the user choose the methods runtime by reading it from file.

The code is readable and the output is clear.
Good implementation of the template functions.
